      <h2>&#x1F44B; Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to VibeCodeKidz! These Terms of Service ("Terms") are the rules for using our platform. By creating an account or using VibeCodeKidz, you agree to follow these terms.</p>
      <p>We've written these terms in plain, kid-friendly language so everyone can understand them. If you're under 13, please review these with a parent or guardian.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>In short:</strong> By using VibeCodeKidz, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, that's okay -- but please don't use the platform until you've talked it over with a parent or guardian.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F476; Who Can Use VibeCodeKidz</h2>
      <p>VibeCodeKidz is designed for kids, teens, and anyone who wants to learn to create games!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All ages welcome</strong> -- but if you're under 13, a parent or guardian must give permission before you can create an account.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental consent is required</strong> for users under 13 in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). A parent or guardian must verify their consent via email.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents and guardians</strong> can manage, review, or delete their child's account at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>COPPA Note:</strong> We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. See our <a href="/privacy.html" style="color:#00d2ff">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.

      <h2>&#x1F511; Your Account</h2>
      <p>Your account is your creative space on VibeCodeKidz. Here's how to keep it safe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep your password secret</strong> -- don't share it with friends, classmates, or anyone other than your parent or guardian.</li>
        <li><strong>One account per person</strong> -- please only create one account for yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't share your login</strong> -- letting someone else use your account means you're responsible for what they do on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Pick a username that doesn't reveal personal info</strong> -- avoid using your real name, school, or location.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you think someone else has accessed your account, tell a parent or guardian right away and contact us so we can help.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F3AE; What You Can Create</h2>
      <p>VibeCodeKidz is all about creativity! You can build games, animations, interactive stories, and all kinds of cool projects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your creations belong to you</strong> -- the games and projects you build are yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it appropriate</strong> -- everything you create should be suitable for all ages. Think: "Would I be comfortable showing this to my teacher or my little sibling?"</li>
        <li><strong>Have fun and experiment</strong> -- there's no wrong way to be creative, as long as you follow these guidelines!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F6AB; What's Not Allowed</h2>
      <p>To keep VibeCodeKidz a safe and fun place for everyone, please don't:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Create inappropriate content</strong> -- no violence, scary stuff, or anything not suitable for all ages.</li>
        <li><strong>Bully or be mean</strong> -- treat everyone with kindness and respect. No harassment, name-calling, or hurtful behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Share personal information in games</strong> -- don't include real names, addresses, phone numbers, school names, or other private info in your projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Copy others' work without permission</strong> -- it's great to be inspired by others, but don't claim someone else's creation as your own.</li>
        <li><strong>Try to break or hack the platform</strong> -- don't attempt to access other people's accounts or mess with how the site works.</li>
        <li><strong>Spam or misuse the AI</strong> -- use the AI assistant for building cool projects, not for generating inappropriate content.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F579; Sharing and the Arcade</h2>
      <p>The Arcade is where you can share your games for others to play!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharing is optional</strong> -- you choose whether to publish your games to the Arcade or keep them private.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared games can be played by others</strong> -- when you publish to the Arcade, other VibeCodeKidz users can play your game.</li>
        <li><strong>You stay in control</strong> -- you can remove your games from the Arcade at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Be a good community member</strong> -- enjoy others' games and be respectful of their creativity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F916; Our AI Assistant</h2>
      <p>VibeCodeKidz includes an AI assistant that helps you build amazing games by turning your ideas into code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-generated content is yours</strong> -- when the AI helps you create a game, that creation belongs to you.</li>
        <li><strong>AI isn't perfect</strong> -- sometimes the AI might make mistakes or create something unexpected. That's okay! You can always ask it to try again or make changes.</li>
        <li><strong>AI has safety filters</strong> -- our AI is designed to keep content appropriate for all ages.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't share personal info with the AI</strong> -- the AI doesn't need your real name, address, or other private details to help you build games.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F4B3; Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>VibeCodeKidz offers both free and paid plans:</p>

        <li><strong>Refunds</strong> -- if you're not happy with a paid plan, contact us within 7 days of being charged and we'll work with you on a refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental responsibility</strong> -- all purchases must be made or approved by a parent or guardian.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Payment processing is handled securely by Stripe. We never store your credit card information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F6E1; We Can Remove Content</h2>
      <p>We want VibeCodeKidz to be a safe, welcoming place. To keep it that way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may <strong>remove games or projects</strong> that violate these terms or contain inappropriate content.</li>
        <li>We may <strong>suspend or remove accounts</strong> that repeatedly break the rules.</li>
        <li>We'll try to <strong>let you know</strong> if we take action on your account, so you understand what happened and why.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you think we made a mistake, reach out to us -- we're happy to take another look.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>&#x1F504; Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time to reflect new features, changes in the law, or other improvements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We'll post the updated terms on this page with a new "Last updated" date.</li>
        <li>For significant changes, we'll notify users through the platform.</li>
        <li>For users under 13, we'll send an update to the parent email on file.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
